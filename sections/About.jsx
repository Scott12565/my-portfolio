          You can call me <span className="font-semibold">Scott.</span>
          I started my journey into web development because I love building things that solve real problems
          and create smooth user experiences.

        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-2 md:mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          Beyond coding, I enjoy experimenting with modern tech and learning from developers
          whoâ€™ve been in the field longer than I have. I believe in writing clean, efficient code and always
          improving my skills to stay ahead in the industry.

          My goal? To build meaningful projects, work with great teams, and continue growing as a developer.
